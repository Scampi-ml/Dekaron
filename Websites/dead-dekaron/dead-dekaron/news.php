<dt><font color='#d41c1c' font size='2'>"Voters" This is why you dont abuse the system!</font></dt>
<dd>Dear Voters,<br><br>
I am sad to announce, that due to all of the players who can do nothing but abuse our voting system, have ruined the 500 coins per vote!<br>
We have now turned the once 1000 coins per day from voting, into 500 coins per day for voting. I never intended on changing the amount of coins from voting, but due to all of the new players
who simply can not read and follow simple instructions. It's sad that everyone has been punish but there are people who insist that 1000 coins a day just is not enough.<br><br>
Do not fret, those that have abused our system will be announced in the forums in a SHAME list.<br><br>

<dt><font color='#d41c1c' font size='2'>New Control Panel To Increase Security</font></dt>
<dd>Players,<br><br>

<font color='#d41c1c' font size='2'>Change Your Passwords!</font><br><br>
Today, we are releasing a temporary control panel for your protection and management of your account.<br>
In this CP, you will be able to change your account information every now and then so you can always know you are safe!<br>
Again, this is only a temporary thing until we are able to afford a control panel Built into the website itself.<br><br>

We recently had some issues with players being hacked by "Friends" or because their passwords were the same in other servers.<br>
We would advise you to change your password if you believe you may have used the same passwords in other servers so this issue won't repeat.<br><br>

We hope you enjoy this new Feature!<br><br>

[Dead Staff]<br><br>

<dt><font color='#d41c1c' font size='2'>A "Special Thanks," From The Staff</font></dt>
<dd>Players,<br><br>
Today on 7/9/2013, on behalf of a "Thank you", we the Staff have decided to give everyone an amount of 5,000 Dekaron Coins to all accounts created and that have logged in before the given date.<br><br>
 
For you to have received the D-shop coins, you needed to have Opened your  D-Shop at least once in one character of an account. Accounts that were made after given
date will not receive the coins, since this is a one-time occurrence. <br><br>

Thank you all for sticking with us and improving our server with all the late difficulties we've been having. This is to show our appreciation of having such a good player base. Thank you once again, we hope you have a great day!<br><br>

[Dead Staff]

<dt><font color='#585858' font size='2'>Laying Siege</font></dt>
<dd>Hello players,<br><br>
As many of you that log-in on a daily basis, you might have realized that the Siege countdown is broken, and siege is not occuring. We are well aware of this fact,
but our priorities at this point in time is not to fix Siege, but instead to balance characters and fix skills, giving everyone a fair fighting chance.<br><br>
Do not fret, for Siege will be fixed in due time, as more players join and improve this server, this is just a "heads-up", so you won't have to worry if you see the countdown once you're in game.<br><br>
As soon as all characters are balanced out and fixed, the next step will be preparing Siege so when it comes around, it will be flawless.
I hope you all understand the reason why Siege is not active, and as always have fun in game.
