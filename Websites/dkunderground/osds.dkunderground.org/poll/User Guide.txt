X-POLL 2.30 User Guide
_______________________

This user guide was created to ensure that you get the most out of what the script has to
offer. We will create a test poll together with full explanation of all the features.
Before we proceed it will be assumed that PHP 4 & MySQL are installed.

Let's Get Started
_______________________

1. Okay first things first, unzip the contents of xpoll.zip to your desired location on
your webserver.

2. Open config.php. We are about to edit some of the variables to ensure X-Poll is
configured with MySQL. Below are descriptions of the values you will need to enter.

	$user_db = This is your MySQL username (DEFAULT = 'root')
	$pass_db = This is your MySQL password (DEFAULT = '')
	$host_db = The name of the host X-Poll resides (e.g. localhost)
	$db = The name of the database where X-Poll will be stored.

The path variables ($dir, $dir2) only need to be edited if you move the images folder, 
which comes with X-Poll, away from where it was originally placed. It is best if you just 
keep it in its default place.

The image properties reflect how the Bar Graph's bar looks when poll results are displayed.

3. Now we will use X-Install to create the database. Point your browser to
install/install.php and follow the options and press install. The database is now setup.
If the database cannot be created due to restrictions on your server try using an existing
database or creating one via your hosts control panel. 

4. Click the here link to be taken to the admin area.

5. You will hopefully see the grey & blue admin area and a notice saying
"There are currently no polls. Please create one.". Now click on the Create A Poll link
which will take us to the add.php page in order for us to do so.

6. You are now asked how many options you want for the Poll. In this example we will use 3.
So type 3 and press the "Step 2 >>"button. I will now run through what all the options
mean:

	Poll Title = The name of the poll (e.g. "Do you like the website?")
	Option 1 = The name of the first option (e.g. "Yes")
	Option 2 = The name of the second option (e.g. "No")
	Poll Starts = The date when the poll starts working
	Poll Expires = The date when the poll stops functioning
	User Can Vote Every = How often the user can vote on the poll (e.g. once a day)
	See Results Before Voting = Are results visible if the user hasn't voted
	See Votes in Results = Display the number of people who have voted on the poll
	Use IP Protection = Prevent users from continuously voting using IP protection.
	Use Cookie Protection = Prevent users from continuously voting using Cookie
				protection.
	Status = Is the poll visible to the public?

Next to the option fields is a drop down list with the images which will be used to
represent that option when poll results are displayed. If you are not sure what images to
use then leave it at random and the poll will randomly choose them when the results are
viewed.

The Poll Expires list allows years up to 2037 because after that the poll stops functioning
on windows machines.

My personal opinions are to turn off Cookie Protection and to just use IP Protection.
Cookies can be deleted at any time by the user, resulting in them being able to vote
continuosly if no other protection is used. IP Protection is pretty much guaranteed. Of
course Dial Up Internet Users who have dynamic IP Addresses could vote multiply but they
are a minority. Wherever you go on the internet people will no doubt have some way to vote
multiply, be it with a proxy or some other way.

For our test poll enter the following.

	Poll Title = Do you like the website?
	Option 1 = Yes | Random
	Option 2 = No | Random
	Poll Starts = LEAVE AS IT IS
	Poll Expires = LEAVE AS IT IS
	User Can Vote Every = MAKE SURE JUST 1 IS SELECTED IN THE MINUTES LIST
	See Results Before Voting = YES
	See Votes in Results = YES
	Use IP Protection = YES
	Use Cookie Protection = NO
	Status = ON

Now press the "Finish >>" button and the poll is created.

7. Now point your browser to the index.php page you extracted. (In the folder outside the
admin one). You will now see the poll you created. Vote on the first option.

8. You will now see the results. Press refresh. You will see the bar colours change
randomly as we selected random when creating the poll. Also notice how the votes themselves
remain constant. This is the IP Protection coming into play. Now wait a minute and revisit
the polls.php page. You are now able to vote again.

The reason is because when we created the poll we chose the "User Can Vote Every" option
as being 1 minute. So since a minute has passed, the user can now vote again.

9. We will now see how the IP Blocker in the Admin Area can be useful. Visit the admin area
again and click on the IP Blocker tab.

This is a feature of X-Poll which allows you to block other people from voting. This is
useful if there is a person on your website who is misusing the polls. For the purposes
of this tutorial it is us who is being the nuisance!

Click on the "Create A Block" button and enter your IP Address in the IP Address field. If
you have a webserver on your computer your ip address will probably be 127.0.0.1. Now
click on the poll entitled "Do you like the website?". Now press the "Finish >>" button and
navigate to the polls.php page. See how only the results are shown and you cannot vote.

10. By now you are probably wondering about the Images tab in the admin area.So, let's 
click on the tab. You now see a list of five images which come bundled with X-Poll. You 
can add to these, rename them and delete them. There is no need to go through this with 
you since it is self explanatory.

Final Word
_______________________

X-Poll is, in my opinion, a pretty feature heavy script. This can be off putting especially
since some you probably only want a basic poll. However all these features I believe are
completely useful and do add a lot to your website. The images option in the admin area is
a little gimicky I admit, but I know some of you out there will find it useful.

I hope that the general reaction is a good one since this is far and away a much better
script than version 1.50 was. The code is now optimised and the script runs faster.
I was a little disappointed with the reaction to version 1.X of X-Poll. A lot of you found
it fantastic, while a number of you had problems with it. I am hoping this is the version
you can all use.

New features are being added all the time so its worth checking back once in a while to see
if there are any improvements.

Anybody who is stil using a version of X-Poll below version 2.0 is heavily advised to
update!!!

Good Luck!
