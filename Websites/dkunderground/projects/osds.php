            	<p>OSDS stands for "Open Source Dekaron Server". Created by janvier123. OSDS was started in August 2009 and was a great success, after that we continued to work on the osds project. It was created as a control panel for admins and users to manage the dekaron server. </p>
                <p>We always listen to the users to get the best ideas and functions to add into the osds project. We have spend countless days on the project developing functions out of thin air. More and more users start to use the osds project, and we are happy with the feedback that we are getting.</p>

                <p>OSDS has come a long way, here are the versions</p>

                <div style="text-align: left;">
                <ul>
                	<li>OSDS V1</li>
                    <li>OSDS V2 <small>(Was never released)</small></li>
                    <li>OSDS V3</li>
                    <li>OSDS V4</li>
                    <li>OSDS V5 (<a href="http://osds.dkunderground.org/">Website</a>)</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Still OSDS is the most used admin panel and still users want access to even more functions, there will be a OSDS V6. The last OSDS V5 (current) runs on a program that is written in Delphi and was using IE as core. Its seems that some users cant even run this, so the next osds will be a PHP version</p>
