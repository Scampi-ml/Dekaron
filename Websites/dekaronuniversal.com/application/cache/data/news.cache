How well will that handle the migration?

As such, even if we migrated everything and scrapped the Steam login\u00a0plug, they wouldn't be able to log in.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\tAny assistance will be greatly appreciated.\n<\/p>\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"clear\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"news_bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/section>\r\n\t<\/article>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<article>\r\n\t\t<h1 class=\"news-head\">\r\n        \t<a href=\"https:\/\/invisionpower.com\/forums\/topic\/435164-pre-purchase-questions\/\" class=\"top\">Pre Purchase Questions<\/a>\r\n            <p>2017\/01\/18<\/p>\r\n        <\/h1>\r\n\t\t<section class=\"body\">\r\n\t\t\t\n<p>\n\tI have some questions before I purchase the Self-Hosted Forums by IPS.\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t1) I need the Forums to use an already existing Username &amp; Password table for login &amp; registration. Is this possible?\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t2) I need the Main Website (separate from the Forums) to log the user into the Forums when they login on the main website (in a nut-shell an external login).\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t3) I would like to encompass the Forums within the website (meaning the Forums its just a section on a page and not the entire page). That being said I know that IPS has Templates, but I want to make sure that PHP SESSION variables from the main website will carry over when visiting pages built around the Forums Template pages. So does IPS support this?\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t4) Does IPS offer an integration service? What I mean by this is there a fee I can pay to have them integrate the forums into my website using the design layout that I want and having the 2 above mentioned features? How long would this take? Would I receive a better response rate than I have up to now...?\n<\/p>\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"clear\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"news_bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/section>\r\n\t<\/article>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<article>\r\n\t\t<h1 class=\"news-head\">\r\n        \t<a href=\"https:\/\/invisionpower.com\/forums\/topic\/435270-a-second-board\/\" class=\"top\">A second board?<\/a>\r\n            <p>2017\/01\/23<\/p>\r\n        <\/h1>\r\n\t\t<section class=\"body\">\r\n\t\t\t\n<p>\n\tHi I currently have an active forum setup but have been thinking of setting up another, do you get discount for multiple licences?\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\tBelow is what I have with my current forums and would want the same, how much is it to setup a second forum with the same features?\n<\/p>\n\n<p>\n\t<a class=\"ipsAttachLink ipsAttachLink_image\" href=\"\/\/dne4i5cb88590.cloudfront.net\/invisionpower-com\/monthly_2017_01\/58865a97940c1_23-Jan-177-28-28PM.png.ea418c5924b012ea9a1cfaa2419cf5d3.png\" data-fileid=\"100551\" rel=\"\"><img class=\"ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed\" data-fileid=\"100551\" src=\"\/\/dne4i5cb88590.cloudfront.net\/invisionpower-com\/monthly_2017_01\/58865a998719f_23-Jan-177-28-28PM.thumb.png.6793869c806087f984bd0191b4966b1f.png\" alt=\"58865a998719f_23-Jan-177-28-28PM.thumb.png.6793869c806087f984bd0191b4966b1f.png\" \/><\/a>\u00a0\n<\/p>\n\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"clear\"><\/div>\r\n\t\t\t<div class=\"news_bottom\">\r\n\t\t\t<\/div>\r\n\t\t<\/section>\r\n\t<\/article>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t<article>\r\n\t\t<h1 class=\"news-head\">\r\n        \t<a href=\"https:\/\/invisionpower.com\/forums\/topic\/435267-converting-from-ning-40\/\" class=\"top\">Converting From Ning 4.0<\/a>\r\n            <p>2017\/01\/23<\/p>\r\n        <\/h1>\r\n\t\t<section class=\"body\">\r\n\t\t\t\n<p>\n\tI have a small Ning community that I would like to convert to IPS. \u00a0I have set up the IPS site and forums already as a template with is substantially different in look and feel from my Ning site.
