									<li><a><i>5/15/2014</i><span class="subheader">Patch 4.1</span></a></li>
									<li><b><u>"New Head Emblems"</u></b><br><br>

You can now have feet emblems, body emblems, and now head emblems. <br>
You can have multiple equipped, but visually only 1 feet, 1 body, and 1 head will show. (Some do mix, like Sun (Body) and Curse (Body).<br><br><br><br>



~Complete Exp Rework~<br><br>

The exp table has been completely redone to work in a smaller scale. <br>
This is to fix the exp bug at really high levels. <br><br>

The main reason we did this. Though we are action 9, we still aren't perfect.<br>
Action 9 still has it's few bugs. "Health Bug" and the "Exp Bug."<br>
The exp bug exists around 45m exp. Currently if you kill a boss with 100m exp,<br>
the exp rolls over just like the health bug. This means your only get a true 10m exp,<br>
due to the exp bug rolling over once, leaving you with about 10m exp.<br><br>

We are working on lower scales. So low in fact that this will completely cure the bug.<br><br>

Please understand that upon doing this we also lowered the overall exp gained throughout<br>
dekaron. You will notice it to be a lot more difficult to level. But don't worry, that is<br>
why we fix the scale. Every boss in the game will now be worth the kill!<br><br><br><br>




~Misc~<br><br>

Raid Party in Dk Square is now fixed. Please report bugs if it still consists.<br>
Rare Tokens are now combined in the d-shop with a new icon.<br>
Shield potion now has a new icon.<br>
All emblems are now combines in the d-shop.<br><br><br><br>




~Coming Soon~<br><br>

New Costumes!<br>
New Accessories! (Dragonic Exchange line.)<br>
New Picking Pets!<br>
More Balancing!<br><br><br><br>

~D-Shop~<br><br>

Red, Gold, and Blue Dragon Wings are now available through the d-shop for 8,000 d-shop coins.<br><br><br><br>



~Monsters-Drops~<br><br>

Critical Drop Rate Fix, Meaning you will see a huge difference when killing monsters and getting a drop from them.<br><br>

Fixed the Drops in the following maps:<br>
Ardeca<br>
Deneb<br>
Python Castle<br>
Tomb of Black Dragon<br>
Cursed Maze<br>
Aquaria Ruins<br>
Land of Illusion<br>
Draviss Field<br>
Miteria (Black Wizard Orb will drop now)<br><br>

Experience increase in Braiken Castle (All Monsters in Braiken Castle got an Experience Boost)<br><br>

Monsters in Ark Arcana will currently not drop any more D-Shop Coins due to the exchange not working properly.<br>
As you guys may have noticed we are working on a lot of things & we will get to the D-Shop exchange as soon as possible. You will<br>
still be able to farm money & Rare Tokens in that map.<br><br><br><br>

~Classes~<br><br>

~Conccerra Summoners~<br><br>
It has been said that there weapons do not increase there damage.<br>
It is in fact increasing the damage and it has been double checked. Remember when using Duel Blades you will want<br>
to use Dex for your main damage. It will not show up as increasing your damage but that's just VISUAL. It does increase your damage<br>
when putting stat points in DEX.<br><br><br><br>

We are getting to everything has fast as we can.<br>
The balancing patch for all 11 Classes is going to be one of the next patches to be released.

Please read the dev blog made for the specifics.<br><br><br><br>



~Misc~<br><br>

Dellamo & Cancimo now give a description on the buff bar. <br>
(We are not yet sure why Dellamo is not a party buff, but we are working on getting it fixed. I promise it has not been forgotten.)<br><br>

Fixed the teleport string on Manuel. It was reported that it said Jerome when looking at the mini map. It now says Manuel as it's suppose to.<br><br>

Fixed the Dark Eye exchange. It should now let you exchange it for Fortyfied Obsideons. (Don't forget you need a certain amount of them to<br> 
exchange for the items.)<br><br>

~New Skills~<br><br>
 
It has finally come, the new 170 part 2, and 180 skills! (48 more skills!)<br>
This is really important and it SHOULD be read!<br><br>
 
There have been a few modifications to the skills and the ways to obtain them!<br><br>
 
"170 part 2, and 180 skills (Newest ones). They are obtained with purchase points! <br>
Here is the tricky part. Purchase points have been removed entirely from abyss and <br>
the only way to get p-points is through dk-square! Your purchase points have been wiped from each of<br>
your characters as well. Each time you complete dk-square, (Win or lose),<br>
you will get purchase points! Gather up as much as you can and get those skills!<br><br>
 
The newest skills can be found in ardeca at (Lowe). Use the minimap (Find NPC) function to help you<br>
figure out where she is.<br><br> 
 
Each skill cost 150k purchase points except for the summoners / concerras. They have 2 extra skill books than<br>
the rest of the classes. They cost a total of 600k purchase points for each class. The reason we did this is<br>
because we want these skills to be EARNED. This will help bring dk-square alive, and useful. You<br>
don't have to worry about how well the others are geared because you are randomly placed on a team,<br>
and you get points for winning and losing."<br><br><br><br>
 
 
 
 
~Crespo Abyss~<br><br>

You will now be able to get a higher grade rank in Crespo abyss, However the only way to obtain Purchase Points will be by doing Dk-Square.<br> 
Purchase Points were removed from every monster in game and all players now have 0 Purchase points. <br>
Yes we wiped them and yes you have to do Dk-Square to obtain them.<br><br><br><br>
 
~Purchase Point shops~<br><br>
 
Due to the decrease in ways to obtain purchase points, all purchase point items have been divided by 50%,<br>
minus the newest skills!<br><br>
 
Two new items have been added into the purchase points shops as well. <br><br>
 
"Dragonic Lachrymae" and "Dragonic Squama".<br><br>
 
Check them out now! Lowe in Ardeca!<br><br><br><br>
 
 
~Colossuem (B-Coins & P-Coins)~<br><br>
 
Darin and Jess in colossuem have gotten new shipments!<br><br>
 
The Old Guardian weapons that were +0 are now +6: --600 B-Coins + 2000 P-Coins-- 1500 B-Coins + 1500 P-Coins<br><br>
 
The old 168-176 gear that were +0 are now 184-188 gear and +5: --1310/3065 B-Coins + 1310/3065 P-Coins-- 750 B-Coins + 750 P-Coins<br><br><br><br>
 
 
 
~Newly implemented maps~<br><br>
 
~Loa castle~<br><br>
 
This map has been entirely revamped by Sergking to be suitable for solo leveling from Lv.160-180!<br><br>
 
Old Mobs Removed Excepted for the 4 original bosses.<br><br>
 
New standard mobs:<br>
Giant's<br>
Mini's<br><br>
 
Bosses:<br>
Blaverus Queen<br>
Grand Mofa<br>
Langrama Arch<br>
Aramon Lord<br><br>
 
All Mobs drop candies except for the bosses.<br><br>
 
The bosses drop 3 to 5 million dil.<br><br>
 
The Giant mobs are located outside of the castle and the<br>
mini mobs are located inside the castle.<br><br>
 
 
You can get to Loa Castle from King Arthur in Ardeca near the spawn.<br><br><br><br>
 
~Braiken Castle~<br><br>
 
This map has been entirely revamped by Zetrey to be suitable for solo leveling from Lv.180-200!<br><br>
 
In 2007 Acclaim released 2moons Closed Beta and along came Braiken Castle, The very first map implemented into 2moons (aka) Dekaron.<br>
Well guess what! We took that map to a whole new level.<br>
We have added Monsters, Traps, and a way for you to gain an adventure as you make your way to the top here in Salvation Dk.<br><br>
 
The main monsters used in this location are the Ice Castle dead front monsters. You will be able to Solo level in this map in case you cannot find a party for the Tower.<br>
The monsters here will drop newly implemented Candies & Buff packs. These buffs and candies will help you out a lot and give you the buffs needed to take down an enemy player easier and<br>
to show your power to the community. There are also hidden Treasure Boxes throughout the map that will re spawn every 20 minutes.<br><br>
 
You can get to Braiken Castle from King Arthur in Ardeca near the spawn.<br><br>
 
Big Thanks to the Staff, Along with Dead and Sergking for the effort and hard work put into this update.

The Set + Belt + Armlet will be permanent, socket-able, mavericable, and gems will go into them now!<br>
The Weps will be permanent, socket able, but not mavericable. They are legendary! Gems will go into them!<br><br>

*Note: We didn't want the items to be mavericable in the first place or permanent, but we did want them functional and able to take gems. They didn't so this is the only solution!<br>
The cost of each donation was slightly increased to compensate for your gains. It was not a big change, please calm down.*<br><br><br><br>





<b>~170 Skill~</b><br><br>

The 170 skills are now added to each of your class skill shops!!! They cost 6m each. Please understand they are the best skills and they should not be easily obtained. <br>
There are even newer skill undergo and will also be released soon but we did not want to ruin those either. More information on the 170 skills part 2 will be added at a later date.<br><br>

*Note: There will be visual issues with the skills icons and etc. Ex: The skills are grey on the skill tree but still work once you learn them and pull them down to your bar.<br>
The icons for the summoner and concerra are the same and resemble the old level 1 cross hack skill icon. These are only visual, but they are still fully functional! They will be fixed.<br>
We don't want to make anyone wait any longer for the release of these awesome skills due to the development of the part 2 170 skills.*<br><br><br><br>





<b>~Exp required to level~</b><br><br>

We noticed that level 1-170 was a walk in the park for most. We want it to be easy to level but we also want you to have time to gear yourselves and have some fun.<br>
The first day of release shows we needed to do this. With the highest level being 180+ we now know that it was a bit low from 180-200.<br><br>

The exp required from level 180-200 has been increased. Further testing will be done.<br><br><br><br>





<b>~Maps + Mobs~</b><br><br>

Under Crespo (Abyss): Argate and maveric drops have been slightly increased.<br>
Castor Dg: All 4 boss's health has been doubled, dil drops have been decreased by 50%, and the exp has been increased! Should be worth the exp now. Also increased the drops from 8 argates to 15!<br><br><br><br>





<b>~Argate Fortification~</b><br><br>

+4 through +7 have been decreased by 2%. (Rates are listed on the features tab of the homepage!)
