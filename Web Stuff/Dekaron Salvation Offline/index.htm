    <h1>Sorry we're closed! :'(</h1>
    
<div class="post entry-content " itemprop="commentText">
     <div><strong>I am sorry to inform everyone that the revamp has been cancelled and the server will be closing between August 1st to August 5th.&nbsp;</strong><strong>We have maintained Salvation since last year 2013 in August when we opened up the Action 3 server. In February of 2014 we opened Action 9.</strong></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><strong>As everyone has noticed the server has died. The revamp was scheduled to take place August 1st, 2014. However we did not even come close to the server cost therefor the server can't stay up. If by some miracle we do get the server cost then Salvation will continue running.</strong></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><strong>We will work on the client while the server is down still and eventually put Salvation back up. I will save and back up the database so that everyones accounts, characters, items, and cash are safe.&nbsp;</strong></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><strong>On behalf of the salvation staff team I would like to say that it has been a great year meeting and getting to know all of you. I wish things could be different but it is what it is.</strong></div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><strong>We will most definitely miss all of you!</strong></div>
