# Dekaron

Hello, everyone.

I was known as Janvier123; you may have heard of me. I was happy to work on projects such as: Beyond Dekaron (Beyond DK), Dekaron Veterans, DKunderground, Salvation Dekaron, Dekaron Evolution, Dekaron9, devdekaron, dead-dekaron, and Dead Dekaron.

This is my final upload. After over a decade of collecting dust, every file I’ve ever worked on during my Dekaron "career" is now gathered in this repository for its final resting place. I cannot upload Dekaron files as they would be taken down for copyright reasons. Additionally, I want to protect any database files as they contain sensitive information such as passwords, emails, usernames, IPs, and more.

It’s been an absolute pleasure to be part of this incredible community, sharing moments of passion and creativity with all of you. But it’s time to finally clean out my hard drive and close this chapter of my life.

I hope my work, though old and outdated, can still bring joy or inspiration to someone out there. Even if just bits and pieces find their way into new projects, that would make me happy.

Goodbye, friends. Thank you for everything. ❤️
